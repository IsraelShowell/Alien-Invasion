# Alien-Invasion
# This is a game developed with Pygame and Python! 
# This game was a project from the Python book, Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.
# Creator: Israel Showell
# Project: Alien Invasion Game
# Current Version: 1.00

This project has furthered my knowledge of Python and Pygame. 
I added a few different things to it myself, and I have plans to add to it.
I typed all the code line by line whilst following this guide.

#How to play
Download the zip file, unzip it in a new folder, and then click the executable!
Note: Windows may read it as a virus, it did on my computer when I packaged it using Pyinstaller.
I played around with some of the arguements to make it work, and it ran fine, but let me know if it gives you any trouble!


Future plans:
Add sounds and music to the game
Make it so that the number of images goes down based on the number of lives 
Make a special bullet power up
Make Easy, Normal, and Hard modes of the game.
Add a super enemy
Add a all-time high score feature
Improve Scoring System
